When using CouchDB on .net projects I had always used a hosting provider such as [Cloudant](https://cloudant.com) or [Iris Couch](http://www.iriscouch.com). Recently, I worked on a project that required a CouchDB instance that was hosted on the same platform which meant I needed to figure out a way to host a CouchDB instance on windows under IIS.

It turned out to be reasonably straightforward.

1. Install CouchDB on the server using a [windows installer](http://couchdb.apache.org/#download).
2. Check the install on the server at [http://localhost:5984](http://localhost:5984).
3. Install the [ARR IIS feature](http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/application-request-routing).
4. Open the ARR feature found at the server root in IIS.
5. Click Server Proxy Settings.
6. Click the checkbox to enable proxy and click apply.
7. Create a site in IIS pointing to an empty folder with a hostname.
8. Open Url Rewrite in the site properties.
9. Add a blank rule with the following properties:
	- Match Url Pattern: .\*
	- Action type: Rewrite
	- Append query string: checked
	- Rewrite Url: 

			http://localhost:5984/{R:0}

10. You should now be able to access the CouchDB instance using the hostname of the IIS site using any/all of the CouchDB HTTP api.
11. The only CouchDB feature that doesnâ€™t work at this point is Continuous Replication. To enable this, set the following properties in the ARR proxy settings:
	- Time-out: 86400
	- Response buffer threshold: 0
12. Check that you can stream from the proxy site using an open connection with a url like:

		http://[CouchDB_Site_Hostname]/[Database_Name]/_changes?feed=continuous&style=all_docs&since=0&heartbeat=10000

You should not have a CouchDB instance running under localhost:5984 that is proxied by a site running in IIS with full support for the CouchDB Http Document API, including replication.
